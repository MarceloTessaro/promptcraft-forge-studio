## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately**.

- Or email: **security@your-domain.com**

**Do not** open public issues or pull requests for vulnerabilities.

### What to include
- Affected version(s) and environment
- Reproduction steps or a minimal PoC
- Expected vs. actual behavior and impact (e.g., RCE, file read/write, XSS)
- Optional: CVSS estimate and suggested fix/mitigation

### Our process / SLA
- We acknowledge within **48 hours** and triage within **5 business days**.
- If confirmed, we work on a fix and coordinate a release.
- We credit reporters by default (or keep you anonymous if you prefer).
- If appropriate, we may request a **CVE** when publishing an advisory.

## Scope
In scope: code in this repository and published packages (e.g., `your-npm-package`).  
Out of scope: deployment misconfiguration, third-party services, DoS without clear impact, issues requiring admin access.

## Disclosure
Please keep reports confidential until a fix is released. We’ll provide status updates during triage and remediation.
